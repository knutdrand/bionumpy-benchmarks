A Snakemake workflow for running benchmarks for bionumpy


## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=Knut Rand%2Fbionumpy-benchmarks).

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) bionumpy-benchmarkssitory and its DOI (see above).

# TODO

* Replace `Knut Rand` and `bionumpy-benchmarks` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `bionumpy-benchmarks` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `Bionumpy Benchmarks` with the workflow name (can be the same as `bionumpy-benchmarks`).
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `Knut Rand` and `bionumpy-benchmarks` were correctly set.
